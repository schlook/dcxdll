
DCX V3.1 TODO List

1: Find better way of updating progressbar's positions upon scroll etc...
	1b: Possibly do away with child controls for listview & instead simply custom draw the item/subitem
2: Add support for more control types in listview items
3: Change How we subclass the controls so we instead handle it all when the class is registered & no subclassing is then needed.
4: WebCtrl has an odd crash, when the object is destroyed & the browser is set as IE11, but not when its set as IE7 (the default). Doesnt crash every time tho, sometimes only on the third try.
5: add more options to settings command...
6: update the docs!!! @svn960 so far, becomes 2.0 at 1020 when changed to utf, becomes 3.0 at ???, becomes 3.1 at ???
